1. The Training pipeline loads the dataset from a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file that's specified when the pipeline runs. Modify the code, so when running in `production` mode, the pipeline loads the data from an S3 bucket. You can supply the S3 bucket name as a parameter to the pipeline. The code should load and combine every CSV file in that bucket.
